                    Hey, I'm Vishal Bhalke, a  Computer Science student who's all about web development. I love solving problems and have a knowledge on Data Structures and Algorithms.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and nodeJs and Express, and I love turning these skills into real-world solutions. The challenge of cracking tough problems and building effective solutions keeps me passionate about web development. <br><br>
                    
                    I'm not just looking for opportunities; I'm eager to jump into projects that can make a difference. Every project is a chance for me to learn and grow. Besides technical skills, I bring fresh ideas, attention to detail, and a hunger for learning. <br><br>
                    
                    I thrive in innovative environments that promote growth. 
                    Challenges aren't obstacles; they're chances for personal and 
                    professional development. Beyond tech, I'm proactive, collaborative, 
                    and ready to be a valuable part of any forward-thinking team. <br><br>
                    I'm excited to use my skills, problem-solving mindset, 
                    and coding knowledge in languages like c,c++ and java to create impactful solutions.</p>
